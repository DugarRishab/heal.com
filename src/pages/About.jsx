					All of this is a result of the ideas that society dictates
					regarding reproductive health.
				</p>
				<p>
					We at Heal recognize the issues that people face everyday
					due to this stigma. It is not in our hands to change
					millions of minds overnight. But it is within our hands to
					make healthcare services more accessible to those who need
					it. Heal strives to remove the middlemen when a person looks
					for reproductive healthcare services, to bring the patient
					directly to the doctor.
				</p>
				<p>
					Heal partners with certified NGOs to bring you the best
					doctors in the business. Heal cooperates with hospitals to
					cater to you the smoothest experience in case you need a
					medical procedure done. We make healing easier.
